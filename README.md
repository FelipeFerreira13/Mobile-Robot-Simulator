# Mobile-Robot-Simulator

Through this installer it is possible to acquire a simulation software for mobile robotic systems. With this it is possible to test and validate the performance of the strategy created by me for the Worldskills Shanghai competition. 
For more information about the software you can see some videos on my Youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVb2UyDGOf5kojiQygPRMbQ), in which it is shown how to use it, and each video has a complete text in the description explaining how the tool works.

The image below shows the interface where all infos are.
